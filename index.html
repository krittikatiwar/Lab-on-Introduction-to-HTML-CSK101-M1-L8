  <h1>DOG</h1>
  <p>The dog is one of the most popular animals in the world. It was one of the first animals to be domesticated, or trained for use by humans. The dogâ€™s scientific name is Canis familiaris. It is related to the coyote, wolves, foxes, and jackals.
  <br><br>
  People around the world keep dogs as pets, guards, or work animals. Some dogs, called feral dogs, do not live with people. These homeless dogs often roam around in groups, called packs. One type of dog, called the dingo, lives in the wild in Australia.</p>
